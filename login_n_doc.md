# Notes on Login and System Documentation in Linux

There are various ways to login in Linux: 
1. Local text-mode console
2. Remote text-mode console
3. Local graphical-mode console
4. Remote graphical-mode console

**Important concepts:**
- Console: Screen where OS displys text and user can input commands
- Terminal Emulator: graphical app that runs in a window and does a similar thing.
- Virtual Terminal: ctrl+alt+F2

This concepts come from the old days of computing, as computers were expensive, companies only bought a single one for everyone. Nevertheless, multiple people could connect to it through different devices and use it, even at the same time.Those devices were *consoles* and *terminals*. Nowadays, they are software, instead of software. 

In CLI you open a virtual terminal; whereas in GUI, you open a terminal emulator to login and type commands.
